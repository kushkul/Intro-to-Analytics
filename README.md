# Introduction-to-Analytics

This is a introductory course that I teach to people who want to dive into Analytics and Data Science.
It is really essential to understand the basics before importing and applying some fancy algorithm on data using scikit-learn or TensorFlow. This course just teaches that. 

After completing this, you would be having a pretty good understanding of tools used in Data Analytics and Data Science. Since this course takes a bottom up approach, you might find the start a little bit trivial, but taking time to jolt down the basic never hurts. And once you are good with that, you don't have to do that again. Ever!
